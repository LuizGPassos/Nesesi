# NESESI Readme

## Introduction

Welcome to the new version of NESESI, an evolution from the prototype "NESESI AI". This revamped version introduces enhanced functionalities, including a robust system for login, registration, and profile settings. We've transitioned from Flask to Django, improving server environments and configurations. Unlike its predecessor, NESESI now transcends language barriers, extending its language learning services from only Portuguese and English to include Japanese and many other languages, catering to speakers of diverse native tongues.

For context, here is the [old repository](https://github.com/LuizGPassos/Nesesi-AI) of "Nesesi AI".

## Background

NESESI is an open-source web chatbot project leveraging OpenAI's GPT-3.5 technology. It's designed to assist, guide, and teach new languages in a didactic, personalized, and adaptable way, ensuring an immersive and effective learning experience for users of all ages, including those with disabilities or disorders.

We are committed to continually developing and enhancing the platform, integrating cutting-edge features and technologies. Future plans include implementing real-time conversations with the chatbot using OpenAI's Whisper and elevenLabs for TTS, and a V-Tuber-like model for heightened immersion and interaction.

As an open-source initiative, contributions to NESESI's development are highly encouraged. Feel free to use this project for your versions or assist in the development of this platform.

## Technologies Used

NESESI is built using:
- HTML 5
- CSS 3
